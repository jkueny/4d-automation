- Changing directions after discussing with Kyle.
- Abandoning the idea of fitting Zernike modes to output surface to 
convert to commands on the DM.
- Will proceed with measuring influence functions with single actuator 
pokes and Hadamard modes. Need plus/minus response measurements for each 
actuator and each of the 1024 modes (for a total of 2048 Hadamard 
measurments).
